# Workout Planner

A focused, mobile-first workout companion designed for simplicity and efficiency.

## The Story
I built this app because I needed a simple way to track my specific workout routine without the bloat of complex fitness apps. I didn't want to deal with user profiles, logins, or ads—just a tool that helps me focus on my workout.

This app is designed to be used in the gym, on your phone. It features a swipe-based interface that lets you move through your exercises seamlessly, just like flipping through cards.

## Features
- **Swipe Navigation**: Move between exercises with a simple swipe left or right.
- **Distraction-Free Interface**: A premium dark mode design that looks great and saves battery.
- **Smart Tracking**: Remembers the weight you used for each exercise automatically (saved to your device).
- **No Login Required**: Your data lives on your phone. No accounts, no cloud sync issues.
- **Visual Cues**: Custom illustrations for each exercise to keep you on track.

## How to Use
1.  **Open the App**: Load the URL on your mobile browser.
2.  **Start Workout**: Tap the start button to begin.
3.  **Track & Swipe**: 
    -   View the exercise details (Sets, Reps, Duration).
    -   Enter your weight (it will be saved for next time).
    -   Swipe **Left** to go to the next exercise.
    -   Swipe **Right** to go back.
4.  **Finish**: Reach the celebration screen and tap Finish to reset.

## Technical Details
